                <p>Natural materials, traditional fine bag making craftsmanship, creative design. And passion for our products and the colourful life they accompany us through – that is what makes <a class="red ft-400" href="https://instagram.com/picard_official?utm_source=ig_profile_share&igshid=xd47wo7h4qau/" target="_blank">PICARD</a> so unique. And has done since 1928.<br>
                Since then, we as a family firm have passed the enthusiasm for beautiful leather goods down from generation to generation. The same goes for the experience and knowledge required for the high-quality processing of leather. In this way PICARD is one of the few training companies that still consistently pass on fine bag craftsmanship.<br>
                Handing down traditions and values, combining this with the spirit of discovery and innovative ideas, the family company has developed into a global player. Today PICARD has a worldwide workforce of more than 2,000 ensuring that our products are loved around the globe. The company assumes responsibility for each individual member of the extended PICARD family, setting the highest standards of quality for. We bear this great responsibility not only to mankind but also to the environment.<br>
                That makes PICARD a brand you can touch. Conscientious, personal, emotional, warm-hearted, lively, curious, fun-loving. As individual as the people who carry PICARD. Let’s call it simply “my favourite brand with tradition”. I love PICARD.</p>
