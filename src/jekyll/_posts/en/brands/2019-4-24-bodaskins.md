Ever since biker jackets were first created they have gained legions of fans throughout each passing decade. The Boda Skins team are no fools, adopting this same classic look for their flagship piece, yet adding their own unique additions and details. The most easily noticeable feature is the heavily padded upper arm sleeves, this is what easily sets them apart from rival brands and also what makes Boda Skins jackets instantly recognisable and so attractive to look at! The black leather looks deliciously expensive, almost a matte colour rather then the deep and dark (and sometimes shiny!) leathers usually on offer.<br>
                As mentioned, the leather looks high end, but upon touching, it feels expensive too! Incredibly soft and supple, particularly the iconic arm padding and the overall feel of the fabric. Fortunately the leather doesn’t have the side effect of being delicate, worrying about damaging your newly acquired jacket can play havoc with your outfit choices!<br>
                Biker leather jackets are an iconic style, one of the few types of clothing which complements almost anything in your wardrobe, the Boda Skins Kay Michaels is no different. Paired dressed down with distressed skinny jeans and sneakers and a crisp white T Shirt or slung over the top of your smart shirt and tie, creating an eye catching combo. Thankfully when it comes to regular wear, this jacket pretty much nails it. With its internal soft padding and buttery feeling leather, you won’t ever feel uncomfortable. It’s a jacket that I can happily wear all day and not feel too restricted.<br></p>
