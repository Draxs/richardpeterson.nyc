Their dream was to construct a unique specialty store that would become synonymous with fashionable, gracious living.<br>
                In the summer of 2000, Saks Fifth Avenue launched saks.com, offering in-store categories, as well as exclusive products and content. Saks.com delivers an enhanced, personalized shopping experience, and is committed to providing the same legendary service and style found in all Saks Fifth Avenue stores.<br>
                On November 4, 2013, Saks Incorporated was acquired by Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), North America's longest continually operated company, joining a portfolio of iconic brands including Hudson's Bay and Lord & Taylor.<br>

The best of European and American designers for men and women are sold throughout its 39 stores servicing customers in 22 states.</p>
